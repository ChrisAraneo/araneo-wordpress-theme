![Logo](src/screenshot-git.png)

Wordpress theme for my personal website. Project is under MIT licence. Latest version: 1.1.0


## Project Installation

In order to install all project files & dependencies you will need _composer_, _npm_.
If you have everything needed run commands below:

```
composer install
npm install
```

## Theme Build

I used _gulp_ for building tasks automation. If you have _gulp-cli_ installed simply run:

```
gulp build
```

After building procedure the ready-to-use theme packed in ZIP is located in _dist_ directory.
